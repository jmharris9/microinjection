% Code to start actual image correlation

% The automation function is the central function and processes all markers and 
% images by the use of the matlab function cpcorr.m. 
% Therefore the Current directory in matlab has to be the folder where 
%  automate_image.m finds the filenamelist.mat, grid_x.dat and grid_y.dat as well 
% as the images specified in filenamelist.mat. Just type automate_image; and 
% press ENTER at the command line of matlab. 
% At first, automate_image.m will open the first image in the filenamelist.mat and 
% plot the grid as green crosses on top. The next step will need some time since 
% all markers in that image have to be processed for the first image. After correlating 
% image one and two the new raster positions will be plotted as red crosses. On top 
% of the image and the green crosses. The next dialog will ask you if you want to 
% continue with this correlation or cancel. If you press continue, automate_image.m 
% will process all images in the filenamelist.mat. The time it will take to process 
% all images will be plotted on the figure but can easily be estimated by knowing the 
% raster point processing speed (see processing speed). 
% Depending on the number of images and markers you are tracking, this process 
% can take between seconds and days. For 100 images and 200 markers a decent 
% computer should need 200 seconds. To get a better resolution you can always 
% run jobs overnight (e.g. 6000 markers in 1000 images) with higher resolutions. 
% Keep in mind that CORRSIZE which you changed in cpcorr.m will limit your 
% resolution. If you chose to use the 15 pixel as suggested a marker distance of 
% 30 pixel will lead to a full cover of the strain field. Choosing smaller marker 
% distances will lead to an interpolation since two neighboring markers share 
% pixels. Nevertheless a higher marker density can reduce the noise of the strain field.
% When all images are processed, automate_image will write the files validx.mat, 
% validy.mat, validx.txt and validy.txt. The text files are meant to store the result in a 
% format which can be accessed by other programs also in the future.
